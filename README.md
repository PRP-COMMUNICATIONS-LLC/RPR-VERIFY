# RPR-VERIFY

## 🛡️ Sovereign Design System

**STRICT TOKEN ADHERENCE: All SCSS must exclusively use tokens defined in `sovereign-tokens.scss`. Prohibited: Inventing new variable names, using absolute hex codes, or referencing ghost symbols. If a semantic distinction is required, it must be added to the core first and passed through a clean build gate.**
