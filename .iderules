# RPR-VERIFY MASTER CONTEXT RULES (ANGULAR 19+)

## Framework Constraints
- **State Management:** ALWAYS use Angular Signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`) instead of `BehaviorSubject` for local and global state.
- **Component Architecture:** All components MUST be `standalone: true`. Every pipe (e.g., `DecimalPipe`) and directive must be explicitly added to the `imports` array.
- **Change Detection:** Default to `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`. Ensure `ChangeDetectionStrategy` is imported from `@angular/core`.

## Path & Token Governance
- **Path Awareness:** All frontend work is in `frontend/src/app/`. Verify paths with `ls` before writing.
- **Efficiency:** IGNORE `node_modules/`, `.angular/`, and `dist/`.
- **Styling:** Use `@use 'src/styles/sovereign-tokens.scss' as *;`. Never hardcode colors.

## Brand Rules
- **Logo:** RPR = White (#FFFFFF). Icon/Verify = Cyan (#00E0FF) by default, Red (#FF0000) if `isEscalated` is true.
