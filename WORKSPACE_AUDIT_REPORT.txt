=== REVIEW LIST ===
[Files/folders candidates for deletion with full paths and reason]

1. ./vercel.json
   Reason: Minimal Vercel config (only "framework": "angular"). Project uses Firebase Hosting, not Vercel. However, scripts/prepare-vercel-output.js references it. May be legacy from previous deployment setup.
   Status: REVIEW - Check if prepare-vercel-output.js is still used in deployment workflows

2. ./trigger_tr01.js
   Reason: Health check script for backend API. Not referenced in frontend/, backend/, scripts/, or package.json scripts.
   Status: DELETE - Appears to be standalone utility script, not integrated into app

3. ./verify_final.js
   Reason: Simple console log script with status message. Not referenced anywhere.
   Status: DELETE - Legacy verification script

4. ./wipe-storage.js
   Reason: Firebase admin script for wiping Firestore storage. Not referenced in frontend/, backend/, scripts/, or package.json scripts.
   Status: DELETE - Standalone utility script

5. ./verify-audit.cjs
   Reason: Firestore audit script. Not referenced in frontend/, backend/, scripts/, or package.json scripts.
   Status: DELETE - Standalone utility script

6. ./deploy_singapore.sh
   Reason: Deployment script for Singapore node. However, scripts/ folder contains multiple deployment scripts (deploy-backend-with-cors.sh, deploy-cloud-run.sh, etc.). Need to verify if this root-level script is still used or if scripts/ versions supersede it.
   Status: REVIEW - Check if referenced in .github/workflows/ or DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

7. ./enhanced-frontend-setup.sh
   Reason: Frontend setup script with WRONG PATH (references CLIENT-2025-003-VERIFY instead of 2025-003-VERIFY). Appears to be legacy from different project structure.
   Status: DELETE - Contains incorrect paths, likely obsolete

8. ./audit_and_align.sh
   Reason: Audit script that scans for shadow files. References cleanup_shadows.sh. Appears to be utility script for workspace maintenance.
   Status: REVIEW - Utility script, but may be useful for maintenance. Check if still needed.

9. ./cleanup_shadows.sh
   Reason: Cleanup script for removing shadow files. Referenced by audit_and_align.sh.
   Status: REVIEW - Utility script, but may be useful for maintenance. Check if still needed.

10. ./forensic_audit_test.sh
    Reason: Test script for forensic audit functionality. Not referenced in frontend/, backend/, scripts/, or package.json scripts.
    Status: REVIEW - May be useful for manual testing, but not integrated into test suite

11. ./safe_git_clean.sh
    Reason: Git utility script for safe cleanup. Not referenced in frontend/, backend/, scripts/, or package.json scripts.
    Status: REVIEW - Utility script, may be useful for maintenance

12. ./node_modules/ (root level)
    Reason: Node modules at root level. Should be gitignored (and is in .gitignore). Root package.json only has devDependencies (concurrently). This may be legitimate for root-level scripts, but typically node_modules should be in frontend/ or backend/functions/.
    Status: REVIEW - Check if root package.json scripts actually need this

13. ./.venv/
    Reason: Python virtual environment. Should be gitignored (and is in .gitignore). Build artifact.
    Status: DELETE - Build artifact, should not be in repo

14. ./venv/
    Reason: Another Python virtual environment. Should be gitignored (and is in .gitignore). Build artifact.
    Status: DELETE - Build artifact, should not be in repo

15. ./.pytest_cache/
    Reason: Python pytest cache. Should be gitignored. Build artifact.
    Status: DELETE - Build artifact, should not be in repo

16. ./service-account.json
    Reason: Service account key file. Should be gitignored (and is in .gitignore). Security-sensitive file.
    Status: DELETE - Security-sensitive file, should not be in repo (already gitignored, but should be removed from filesystem if committed)
